Class is a main part in OOP bec. its essintialy a blueprint you creat opject from and has core OOP fundementals and Functions, Can have methods, fields, properties, events, constructors, destructors, etc.
is passed by refrence

Struct is like a class but with some diffrences like
> its  passed by value
> can't have a parameterless Constructor
> doesn't support Inheretance or polymorphism

Records can be class-based or struct-based or just records 
>it has Built-in value-based equality for all members (like comparing by "content").
>designed for immutable data where basicly once the obj. is created nither its fields nor its values are changed So to make any change you make a new obj. with some modifications to the first one
